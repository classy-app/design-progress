I've been thinking about making a classroom app similar to Google Classroom, but with more features, and open-source, for free! Essentially the app should give a similar experience to Google Classroom, but with more features like attendance checks, leave requests, and more.

## Things I've added today

- Classes today page
- Profile page
- Navigation drawer
- Leave request dialog
