Today, I've added the subject page (with its tabs), and the notifications page! A lot of new components being added really quickly. I think I should start organizing them, otherwise it'd look like a mess!

## Things I've added today

- Subject page (and its tabs)
- Notifications page
- Attendance card component
- User display component
